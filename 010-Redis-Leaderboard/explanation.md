### Redis Sorted Sets
Redis Sorted Sets are an advanced data structure that combines characteristics of sets and sorted lists.

Each element in a Sorted Set is:
- associated with a score
- elements are sorted according to these scores

Sorted Sets are an excellent solution for implementing a leaderboard for several reasons:

Automatic sorting: Sorted Sets store elements sorted by their score. This makes it easy and immediate to obtain a ranked list of elements, which is essential for a leaderboard.

Efficiency: operations such as inserting, updating scores, and reading ranks are very fast, with O(log N) complexity. This ensures that the leaderboard can scale even with a large number of users.

Built-in ranking functions: Sorted Sets provide specific commands to get the rank of an element (ZRANK), elements within a score range (ZRANGEBYSCORE), and to add or update elements (ZADD).

Support for complex operations: Sorted Sets allow for complex operations such as obtaining elements with scores within a specific range, or elements with scores higher or lower than a certain value, enabling the creation of leaderboards with advanced features.

No duplicates: Being a set, Sorted Sets do not allow duplicate elements. Each element is unique, which simplifies the management of unique entries in the leaderboard.

So which is better? Redis Sorted Sets or database modeling?

Using Redis Sorted Sets for a leaderboard offers significant advantages over a relational database solution.

Redis provides built-in operations for managing leaderboards, such as ZRANK, ZRANGE, and ZADD, which simplify data manipulation compared to the complex SQL queries required in relational databases.

Redis automatically sorts elements by score, reducing computational overhead and enhancing performance.

Additionally, Redis's scalability makes it ideal for applications that require frequent updates and quick access to ordered data.
