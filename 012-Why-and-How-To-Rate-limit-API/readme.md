# Why and How You Should Rate-Limit Your API

APIs are the backbone of modern web services, enabling applications to communicate and share data seamlessly. However, with great accessibility comes the challenge of managing resource usage and ensuring service reliability. Rate-limiting is a crucial strategy to protect your API from abuse, prevent server overloads, and provide a fair usage environment for all clients.

### **Introduction**

In modern API development, **Rate Limiting** is a critical feature that helps protect your API from abuse, prevents overuse of resources, and ensures a fair usage policy. In this post, we’ll explore one of the most commonly used rate limiting strategies, **Fixed Window Rate Limiting**, and how to implement it in a .NET Web API project.

### **What is Fixed Window Rate Limiting?**

**Fixed Window Rate Limiting** restricts the number of requests a client can make to an API within a fixed time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute). If the client exceeds the allowed number of requests within this time frame, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response until the window resets.

This approach is ideal when you want predictable enforcement of rate limits and don't need fine-grained control over request distribution.

### **How Fixed Window Rate Limiting Works**

- **Time Window**: In this approach, the rate limiter tracks requests within a fixed interval of time (e.g., 1 minute).
- **Permit Limit**: You define the maximum number of requests allowed within this time window.
- **Simple and Predictable**: If a user makes more requests than allowed, they are blocked for the remainder of the time window.
  
For example, if you set the window to 1 minute and allow 100 requests, a client can send 100 requests in that minute. Once the limit is exceeded, any further requests within that minute will be rejected.

### **Why Use Rate Limiting?**

Rate limiting ensures:
- **API Protection**: It protects your API from being overwhelmed by excessive requests, either accidentally or maliciously.
- **Fair Usage**: It ensures that resources are distributed evenly across all users.
- **Improved Stability**: It helps in maintaining the stability and performance of your application by controlling the load on your server.

### **Steps to Implement Fixed Window Rate Limiting in .NET**

Let's walk through the process of setting up Fixed Window Rate Limiting in a .NET Web API.

#### **Step 1: Setting Up the Rate Limiting Policy**

In the `Program.cs` file of your .NET Web API, you configure the rate limiting middleware. Here’s how you can define a simple Fixed Window Rate Limiting policy:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.AddFixedWindowLimiter(policyName: "FixedWindowPolicy", options =>
    {
        options.Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1); // Time window
        options.PermitLimit = 100; // Max requests per window
        options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst;
        options.QueueLimit = 0; // No queuing of excess requests
    });

    // Optional: Customize the response when rate limit is exceeded
    options.OnRejected = async (context, cancellationToken) =>
    {
        context.HttpContext.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status429TooManyRequests;
        await context.HttpContext.Response.WriteAsync("Too many requests. Please try again later.", cancellationToken);
    };
});
```

In this configuration:
- We set a time window of 1 minute (`TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)`).
- The `PermitLimit` of 100 allows a maximum of 100 requests per minute.
- When the limit is exceeded, clients receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a custom message.

#### **Step 2: Applying Rate Limiting to a Specific Route**

To apply rate limiting to specific routes, you use the `[EnableRateLimiting]` attribute in your controller. For example, if we want to apply the **Fixed Window** rate limiting policy to the `GetAllEmployees_Fixed_Window` endpoint of our `EmployeeController`, we do it like this:

```csharp
[HttpGet("fixed-window")]
[EnableRateLimiting("FixedWindowPolicy")] // Apply the fixed window rate limiting policy
public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<Employee>>> GetAllEmployees_Fixed_Window()
{
    return await _dbContext.Employees.ToListAsync();
}
```

In this code:
- The `EnableRateLimiting` attribute binds the `FixedWindowPolicy` to this specific route, so the limit will only apply to requests made to this endpoint.

#### **Step 3: Testing the Rate Limiting**

Once the rate limiting is in place, you can test it by sending multiple requests to the `api/employee/fixed-window` endpoint.

- **Normal Behavior**: For the first 100 requests within a minute, the server will respond normally.
- **After Limit Exceeds**: On the 101st request (within the same minute), the server will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

This helps in verifying that your API is well-protected from excessive usage while still allowing users to make the defined number of requests in each window.

### **When to Use Fixed Window Rate Limiting**

**Fixed Window Rate Limiting** is ideal when:
- You want simplicity and predictability.
- You don't need granular control over the distribution of requests within the time window.
- You are okay with "bursting," where all allowed requests can be made at the start of the window, potentially overloading the server temporarily.

However, if you need smoother request distribution or want to avoid bursts of requests, consider using **Sliding Window Rate Limiting** or the **Token Bucket** algorithm.
